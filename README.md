## Standard Workflow

1. Clone this repository down to your computer.
1. In the GitHub Desktop app, [create a branch for your work](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/creating-a-branch-for-your-work/#creating-a-branch).
1. Open the entire folder you downloaded in Atom.
1. Make your first change to the code. (You could modify this README.md file by adding your username next to the project in the heading, for example.)
1. In the GitHub Desktop app, create a commit. You *must* type a "summary"; "description" is optional.
1. Click Publish. Verify that your branch is now visible on your fork at GitHub.com in the "Branch" dropdown.
1. **Commit and Sync often as you work.**
1. Make new branches freely to experiment. You can always switch back to an older branch and start over. **When in doubt, create a branch.**
1. Run `rails grade` as often as you like to see how you are doing.
1. You can push commits and `rails grade` right up until the due date.
1. If you have a question about your code, a great way to get feedback is to open a [Pull Request](../../compare). After creating it, if you include the URL of your Pull Request when you post your question, reviewers will be able to easily see the changes you've made and leave comments on each line of your code with suggestions.
